Trying to to follow the tutorial by Program With Gio YouTube Channel [Learn PHP The Right Way - Full PHP Tutorial For Beginners & Advanced - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3d3QYzkw2xabQRUpcZ_IBk9W50M9pe-)

Web server: Apache, Nginx

PHP Installation in OS: Manual Installation, Manual DB Installation, Manual Configuration

XAMPP/MAMP/WAMP: All in one solution
Contains web server, contains database, preconfigured

An alternative to xampp is Laragon (laragon.org). It has more features like ngrok integrated to share your local website.  
Need to have a better understanding of dependencies.

Virtual Machines/Docker: Better alternative


For beginners, XAMPP is alright, but not alright for production.
Because can't have multiple PHP versions, No multiple MySQL versions, difficult to maintain multiple projects, "works on my machine"
Download it from [XAMPP Installers and Downloads for Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)


Need to study static variables how to use it. 
Similarly have to practice the things discussed in the video of "Variable, Anonymous, Callable, Closure & Arrow Functions"

Might need to check the video of "Docker Tutorial - Nginx - PHPFPM VS Apache"
Later on need to know how to do routing setup
